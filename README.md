**Text Entry Detection**
A Flask and JavaScript-based project to detect the mode of text entry (typed or copy-pasted) in a text input field. This application can help identify potential 
copy-pasting behavior versus natural typing based on typing intervals and paste events.

**Features**
Typing Mode Detection: Determines whether the text was typed or copy-pasted.
Real-Time Analysis: Detects typing intervals to analyze input patterns.
Simple UI: Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the detection system.

**Use Cases**
Examination Settings: Detect if users are copying text rather than typing answers.
Content Quality Assurance: Analyze typing patterns to differentiate between original and duplicated content.
User Behavior Analysis: Study user behavior in forms, surveys, or applications where typing patterns may reveal additional insights.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Flask (pip install flask)
Flask-CORS (pip install flask-cors)
